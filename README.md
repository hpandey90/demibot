##**DemiBot : Chatter Bot**

## Synopsis

A chatbot developed using sequence to sequence model is capable of predicting next sentence based on previous sentence/conversations. We trained our model on movie dialogue corpus and twitter dataset to have a conversation.

## Language and Libraries

Python : 3.6
Tensorflow : 1.0.0
Nltk : 3.2.2

## Motivation

To create an agent that can have conversation like humans is one of the open area in machine learning which attracts pool of talent to solve and come up with a solution to the problem. To address this problem of open ended discussion we have developed a conversational model using machine learning which is generative in nature and is capable of having open conversations.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## Running

If saved model is downloaded to '/ckpt' folder then run below:
  python ui.py
else
  download saved model or train:
  If train then:
    python demiBot.py
  else:
    download model
